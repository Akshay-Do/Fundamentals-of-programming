<h3>ABOUT ME:</h3>
I am Akshay Dodhia, i am a student at USIU Africa and I am currently majoring in computer science. I enjoy coding and programming and during my free time i do some photography, read books and listening to music.<br><br>
I am currently learning fundamentals of programming and the course has helped me understand the core concepts of programming and programming languages and it has allowed me to gain a thorough grasp of the syntax, semantics, and various programming paradigms, as well as the significance of programming languages in software development, acquired through a combination of academic coursework and pertinent practical tasks. <br><br>
